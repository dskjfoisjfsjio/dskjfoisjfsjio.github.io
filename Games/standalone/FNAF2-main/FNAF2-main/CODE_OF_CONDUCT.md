# FNAF2 HTML5 Port - Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the FNAF2 HTML5 Port project, we pledge to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone involved. We value the participation of all individuals and expect mutual respect among contributors. To ensure a positive and harassment-free experience for everyone, we have established the following guidelines:

## 1. Be Respectful

Treat others with kindness, respect, and empathy. Be open to different viewpoints and constructive criticism. Remember that everyone's contributions are valuable, and personal attacks or derogatory comments will not be tolerated.

## 2. Foster Inclusivity

We welcome contributors from all backgrounds, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, or disability. Create an inclusive environment by being mindful of language and actions that may exclude or marginalize others.

## 3. Maintain a Safe Environment

Harassment and any form of discriminatory behavior are unacceptable. This includes but is not limited to offensive comments, threats, intimidation, or unwanted advances. Report any issues to the project maintainers, who will address them promptly and confidentially.

## 4. Collaborate and Communicate

Encourage constructive discussions and support each other's ideas. Be open to collaboration and provide helpful feedback. Strive to create an environment where all contributors feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and opinions.

## 5. Respect Privacy

Respect the privacy and confidentiality of others. Avoid sharing personal information without explicit consent. Be mindful of potential legal and ethical implications when handling sensitive data.

## 6. Follow Licensing and Copyright

Ensure that all contributions comply with the project's licensing requirements and respect copyright laws. Only contribute content that you have the right to distribute and license under the project's chosen license.

## 7. Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may result in temporary or permanent exclusion from the project. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to enforce this Code of Conduct by taking appropriate actions, which may include warning, moderation, or removal of contributions, as deemed necessary.
