        <h1>Nintendo games are completely removed as of 2/14/25</h1>
        <strong>Why</strong>
        <p>Simply because I don't want to get DMCA'ED by Nintendo. They really go after anything, and my website will (most likely) be attacked by them if they find out I'm hosting their games. (It's also illegal.)
        </p>

        <p>In short, sorry to all the users if you enjoyed them, but they have to be removed for the websiteâ€™s safety and so that I don't have to go to court in the future. Thanks, and there will be more updates to come to (hopefully) replace these games and make up for the loss of the majority of games on this website.</p>

        <strong>Is there any other way to play them?</strong>
        <p>You can still play Nintendo games by obtaining your own ROMs and using the EmulatorJS app.</p>
